## Core Principles

### 1. Documentation as Code
- Store documentation in version control alongside code
- Use markdown for human-readable docs
- Generate API docs from code annotations
- Review documentation changes like code changes

### 2. Audience-First Writing
- Write for your intended audience (developers, operations, end users)
- Use appropriate technical depth
- Include practical examples
- Provide clear next steps

### 3. Living Documentation
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Link documentation updates to feature development
- Regular review cycles for accuracy
- Automated checks where possible

### 4. Discoverability
- Consistent naming conventions
- Clear navigation structure
- Search-friendly content
- Cross-references and links
