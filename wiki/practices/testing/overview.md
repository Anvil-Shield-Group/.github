## Testing Philosophy

### Test Pyramid Strategy

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Test Pyramid"
        E2E[End-to-End Tests<br/>10% - Critical User Journeys]
        INT[Integration Tests<br/>20% - Service Interactions]
        UNIT[Unit Tests<br/>70% - Business Logic]
    end
    
    E2E --> INT
    INT --> UNIT
    
    subgraph "Characteristics"
        SLOW[Slow, Expensive, Brittle] --> E2E
        MED[Medium Speed, Moderate Cost] --> INT
        FAST[Fast, Cheap, Reliable] --> UNIT
    end
```

### Core Principles
1. **Test Early, Test Often** - Shift-left testing approach
2. **Automate Everything Possible** - Reduce manual testing overhead
3. **Tests as Documentation** - Clear behavior specification
4. **Maintainable Test Code** - Same quality standards as production code
5. **Fast Feedback Loops** - Quick test execution for rapid iteration

## Current State Assessment

### Cross-Stack Challenges
- **Inconsistent Coverage**: Test coverage varies from 30-85% across repositories
- **Flaky Tests**: Intermittent failures in CI pipelines causing deployment delays
- **Slow Test Suites**: Some integration tests taking 10+ minutes
- **Limited E2E Coverage**: Critical user journeys not adequately tested
- **Test Data Management**: Inconsistent approaches to test data setup/teardown

### Success Stories
- **Payment Processing**: 95% coverage with comprehensive edge case testing
- **Authentication Services**: Robust security testing with penetration test integration
- **API Gateway**: Strong contract testing between microservices

## Testing Standards Summary

### Coverage Targets by Stack

| Stack | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | E2E Tests | Overall Target |
|-------|------------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Spring Boot | 85% | 70% | Critical paths | 80% |
| ASP.NET Core | 85% | 70% | Critical paths | 80% |
| NextJS | 80% | 60% | Key user flows | 75% |
| Flutter | 80% | 65% | Core features | 75% |
| Laravel (Legacy) | Current state | Maintain existing | Document for migration | N/A |

### Quality Gates

#### CI/CD Requirements
- [ ] **Unit tests pass**: 100% pass rate required
- [ ] **Coverage threshold**: Must meet minimum coverage for stack
- [ ] **Integration tests pass**: Core service interactions validated
- [ ] **Security scans**: No critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks**: Response times within SLA

#### Code Review Requirements
- [ ] **New code coverage**: New features must have 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] **Test quality**: Tests follow naming conventions and best practices
- [ ] **Edge cases covered**: Error conditions and boundary cases tested
- [ ] **Mocking strategy**: Appropriate use of mocks vs real dependencies
