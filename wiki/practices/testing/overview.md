## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive testing standards across all technology stacks to ensure code quality, system reliability, and confidence in deployments.

## Quick Navigation

### By Technology Stack
- [üçÉ Spring Boot Testing](spring-boot.md) - Java testing standards and frameworks
- [‚ö° ASP.NET Core Testing](aspnet.md) - C# testing conventions and tools
- [‚öõÔ∏è NextJS Testing](nextjs.md) - Frontend testing patterns and practices
- [üì± Flutter Testing](flutter.md) - Mobile app testing strategies

### By Test Type
- [üß™ Unit Testing Standards](types/unit-testing.md) - Isolated component testing
- [üîó Integration Testing](types/integration-testing.md) - Service interaction testing
- [üé≠ End-to-End Testing](types/e2e-testing.md) - Full user journey testing
- [‚ö° Performance Testing](types/performance-testing.md) - Load and stress testing
- [üîí Security Testing](types/security-testing.md) - Vulnerability and penetration testing

## Testing Philosophy

### Test Pyramid Strategy

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Test Pyramid"
        E2E[End-to-End Tests<br/>10% - Critical User Journeys]
        INT[Integration Tests<br/>20% - Service Interactions]
        UNIT[Unit Tests<br/>70% - Business Logic]
    end
    
    E2E --> INT
    INT --> UNIT
    
    subgraph "Characteristics"
        SLOW[Slow, Expensive, Brittle] --> E2E
        MED[Medium Speed, Moderate Cost] --> INT
        FAST[Fast, Cheap, Reliable] --> UNIT
    end
```

### Core Principles
1. **Test Early, Test Often** - Shift-left testing approach
2. **Automate Everything Possible** - Reduce manual testing overhead
3. **Tests as Documentation** - Clear behavior specification
4. **Maintainable Test Code** - Same quality standards as production code
5. **Fast Feedback Loops** - Quick test execution for rapid iteration

## Testing Standards Summary

### Coverage Targets by Stack

| Stack | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | E2E Tests | Overall Target |
|-------|------------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Spring Boot | 85% | 70% | Critical paths | 80% |
| ASP.NET Core | 85% | 70% | Critical paths | 80% |
| NextJS | 80% | 60% | Key user flows | 75% |
| Flutter | 80% | 65% | Core features | 75% |
| Laravel (Legacy) | Current state | Maintain existing | Document for migration | N/A |

### Quality Gates

#### CI/CD Requirements
- [ ] **Unit tests pass**: 100% pass rate required
- [ ] **Coverage threshold**: Must meet minimum coverage for stack
- [ ] **Integration tests pass**: Core service interactions validated
- [ ] **Security scans**: No critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks**: Response times within SLA

#### Code Review Requirements
- [ ] **New code coverage**: New features must have 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] **Test quality**: Tests follow naming conventions and best practices
- [ ] **Edge cases covered**: Error conditions and boundary cases tested
- [ ] **Mocking strategy**: Appropriate use of mocks vs real dependencies

## Testing Tools & Frameworks

### Approved Testing Stack

| Category | Spring Boot | ASP.NET Core | NextJS | Flutter |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Unit Testing** | JUnit 5 + Mockito | xUnit + Moq | Jest + Testing Library | flutter_test |
| **Integration** | TestContainers | WebApplicationFactory | Supertest | integration_test |
| **E2E Testing** | Selenium WebDriver | Playwright | Cypress | Patrol |
| **API Testing** | RestAssured | HttpClientFactory | Supertest | http package |
| **Mocking** | Mockito + WireMock | Moq + MockHttp | Jest mocks | mockito |
| **Coverage** | JaCoCo | Coverlet | Istanbul/nyc | Built-in |

### Supporting Tools
- **Test Data**: Docker containers for databases, Testcontainers
- **CI Integration**: Azure DevOps Test Plans, GitHub Actions
- **Reporting**: Azure Test Results
- **Performance**: JMeter

## Metrics & Success Criteria

### Key Performance Indicators

| Metric | Current Baseline | 3-Month Target | 6-Month Target |
|--------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Overall Test Coverage | 0% | 75% | 80% |
| CI Test Execution Time | ~10 min | <10 min | ~8 min |
| Bug Escape Rate | 8% | 4% | 0% |

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Reliability**: % of tests that pass consistently
- **Coverage Quality**: % of critical paths covered by tests
- **Test Maintainability**: Time spent on test maintenance vs feature development
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Survey scores on testing experience

## Getting Started

### For New Team Members
1. Review your stack-specific testing guide
2. Set up local testing environment using [setup guides](../tools/testing-setup.md)
3. Run existing test suites to understand current patterns
4. Write your first test following our [templates](../../templates/testing/)

### For Existing Projects
1. Run coverage analysis using stack-specific tools
2. Identify critical paths lacking test coverage
3. Create improvement plan using our [assessment template](../../templates/testing/coverage-assessment.md)
4. Implement tests incrementally, focusing on high-risk areas

### For New Projects
1. Start with test-driven development (TDD) approach
2. Use our [project templates](../../templates/projects/) which include testing setup
3. Aim for 90%+ coverage from day one
4. Set up automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
