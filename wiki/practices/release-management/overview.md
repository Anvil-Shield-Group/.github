### Release Strategy Principles

1. **Predictable Releases**: Regular, scheduled releases with consistent processes
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and gradual rollouts
3. **Fast Recovery**: Quick rollback capabilities and incident response
4. **Stakeholder Communication**: Clear, timely updates to all affected parties
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular retrospectives and process optimization
6. **Automated Where Possible**: Reduce manual errors through automation
7. **Quality Over Speed**: Never compromise quality for release deadlines

## Current State Assessment

### Release Management Challenges

| Challenge | Impact | Current State | Target State |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Inconsistent Release Cadence** | Unpredictable delivery | Ad-hoc releases | Bi-weekly scheduled releases |
| **Manual Release Steps** | Error-prone, slow | 60% manual | 90% automated |
| **Limited Rollback Testing** | High risk deployments | Quarterly testing | Every release tested |
| **Cross-Service Coordination** | Deployment conflicts | Reactive coordination | Proactive orchestration |
| **Release Communication** | Stakeholder confusion | Inconsistent updates | Standardized communication |

### Success Areas
- **CI/CD Foundation**: Basic automated deployment pipelines in place
- **Environment Management**: Clear separation between dev, staging, and production
- **Monitoring Integration**: Good post-deployment health monitoring
- **Team Collaboration**: Strong collaboration within individual teams

## Release Versioning Standards

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

All projects must follow semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

```
Version Format: X.Y.Z

MAJOR (X): Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
MINOR (Y): New features, backward-compatible functionality
PATCH (Z): Bug fixes, backward-compatible patches

Examples:
- 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 (bug fix)
- 1.0.1 → 1.1.0 (new feature)
- 1.1.0 → 2.0.0 (breaking change)
```

### Version Management by Stack

| Stack | Version Pattern | Example | Special Considerations |
|-------|----------------|---------|------------------------|
| **Spring Boot** | `X.Y.Z` | `2.1.3` | Align with Spring Boot major versions |
| **ASP.NET Core** | `X.Y.Z` | `1.4.2` | Follow .NET release schedule |
| **NextJS** | `X.Y.Z` | `3.2.1` | Consider NextJS framework updates |
| **Flutter** | `X.Y.Z+B` | `1.2.0+5` | Build number (B) for app store submissions |

### Pre-Release Versioning

```
Pre-release Identifiers:
- alpha: Early development, major features incomplete
- beta: Feature complete, undergoing testing
- rc (release candidate): Ready for release, final testing

Examples:
- 2.0.0-alpha.1
- 2.0.0-beta.2
- 2.0.0-rc.1
- 2.0.0 (final release)
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment (Production Standard)

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Load Balancer"
        LB[Application Gateway]
    end
    
    subgraph "Blue Environment (Current)"
        BLUE1[Instance 1 - v1.2.0]
        BLUE2[Instance 2 - v1.2.0]
        BLUE3[Instance 3 - v1.2.0]
    end
    
    subgraph "Green Environment (New)"
        GREEN1[Instance 1 - v1.3.0]
        GREEN2[Instance 2 - v1.3.0]
        GREEN3[Instance 3 - v1.3.0]
    end
    
    subgraph "Monitoring"
        HEALTH[Health Checks]
        METRICS[Performance Metrics]
        ALERTS[Error Monitoring]
    end
    
    LB --> BLUE1
    LB --> BLUE2
    LB --> BLUE3
    
    GREEN1 -.-> HEALTH
    GREEN2 -.-> METRICS
    GREEN3 -.-> ALERTS
```

**Deployment Process:**
1. **Preparation**: Deploy new version to Green environment
2. **Validation**: Run health checks and smoke tests on Green
3. **Traffic Shift**: Gradually move traffic from Blue to Green (5%, 25%, 50%, 100%)
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor metrics during each traffic shift phase
5. **Completion**: Once stable, mark Green as active, keep Blue for rollback
