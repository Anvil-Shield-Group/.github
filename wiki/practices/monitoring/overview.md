### Monitoring Maturity Model

| Level | Characteristics | Tools Used | Coverage | Team Capability |
|-------|----------------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| **L1: Reactive** | Basic health checks, manual log review | Azure Monitor, file logs | Core services only | React to outages |
| **L2: Proactive** | Structured logging, basic alerting | Application Insights, centralized logs | All services | Prevent some issues |
| **L3: Predictive** | APM, anomaly detection, SLA monitoring | Full APM suite, ML alerts | End-to-end visibility | Anticipate problems |
| **L4: Intelligent** | Auto-healing, capacity prediction | AI-driven insights, automated responses | Business-driven monitoring | Self-healing systems |

**Current State**: Transitioning from L1 to L2  
**Target State**: Achieve L3 within 6 months

## Current State Assessment

### Monitoring Challenges
- **Fragmented Tooling**: Different monitoring approaches across technology stacks
- **Alert Fatigue**: High false positive rate (>30%) causing important alerts to be missed
- **Limited Correlation**: Difficult to trace issues across service boundaries
- **Reactive Posture**: Most monitoring alerts after problems occur rather than preventing them
- **Inconsistent Logging**: Log formats and verbosity levels vary significantly between services

### Success Areas
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Azure Monitor provides comprehensive infrastructure visibility
- **Database Performance**: SQL Server monitoring is well-established with good alerting
- **Basic APM**: Application Insights covers core performance metrics for critical services
- **Security Logging**: Audit trails and security events are consistently logged

### By Technology Stack Assessment

| Stack | Current Maturity | Key Gaps | Priority Actions |
|-------|------------------|----------|------------------|
| **Spring Boot** | L2 - Proactive | Distributed tracing, business metrics | Implement OpenTelemetry |
| **ASP.NET Core** | L2 - Proactive | Cross-service correlation | Enhance Application Insights |
| **NextJS** | L1 - Reactive | User experience monitoring, error tracking | Add Sentry, implement RUM |
| **Flutter** | L1 - Reactive | Crash reporting, performance monitoring | Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics |
| **Laravel** | L1 - Reactive | Modern monitoring stack | Document for C# migration |

## Monitoring Standards Summary

### Universal Requirements

#### Logging Standards
- **Format**: Structured JSON logging for all applications
- **Correlation**: Request correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- **Retention**: Error logs 6 months, info logs 3 months, debug logs 1 month
- **Security**: No PII or sensitive data in logs
- **Performance**: Async logging to prevent performance impact

#### Metrics Standards
- **Golden Signals**: Latency, traffic, errors, saturation for all services
- **Business Metrics**: Revenue, conversion, user engagement tracking
- **SLA Targets**: 99.9% availability, p95 response time <500ms
- **Custom Metrics**: Business-specific KPIs for each service

#### Alerting Standards
