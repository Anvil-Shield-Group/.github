### Quality Maturity Model

| Level | Characteristics | Automation | Review Process | Metrics Tracking |
|-------|----------------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **L1: Basic** | Manual code reviews, basic formatting | None | Informal reviews | No metrics |
| **L2: Standardized** | Consistent style guides, linting tools | Basic linting | Structured reviews | Basic metrics |
| **L3: Automated** | Automated quality gates, comprehensive analysis | Full automation | Review checklists | Comprehensive metrics |
| **L4: Optimized** | AI-assisted reviews, predictive quality | ML-powered | Continuous improvement | Predictive analytics |

**Current State**: Transitioning from L2 to L3  
**Target State**: Achieve L3 within 3 months, L4 within 12 months

## Current State Assessment

### Quality Challenges by Stack

| Stack | Current Issues | Quality Gates | Tool Coverage | Priority |
|-------|----------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **Spring Boot** | Inconsistent formatting, high complexity methods | Partial | SonarQube setup needed | High |
| **ASP.NET Core** | Code style variations, insufficient analysis | Basic | StyleCop + SonarQube partial | High |
| **NextJS** | ESLint config variations, no Prettier enforcement | Manual | ESLint only | Medium |
| **Flutter** | Dart analysis not enforced, formatting inconsistent | None | Basic Dart analysis | Medium |

### Review Checklist

#### Functional Review
- [ ] **Logic Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Are error conditions and edge cases handled?
- [ ] **Business Logic**: Does the implementation match requirements?
- [ ] **Integration**: Does it work correctly with existing systems?

#### Code Quality Review
- [ ] **Readability**: Is the code clear and easy to understand?
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Can this code be easily modified in the future?
- [ ] **Performance**: Are there any obvious performance issues?
- [ ] **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?

#### Design Review
- [ ] **Architecture**: Does the code follow established architectural patterns?
- [ ] **SOLID Principles**: Are SOLID principles followed appropriately?
- [ ] **Coupling**: Is coupling between components minimized?
- [ ] **Cohesion**: Are related functions grouped together logically?

### Review Guidelines

#### Constructive Feedback Examples

**Good Feedback:**
```
💡 Consider extracting this logic into a separate method to improve readability:

```typescript
// Current code
if (user.age >= 18 && user.hasValidId && user.isNotBlacklisted && user.hasConsent) {
    // 20 lines of processing
}

// Suggested refactor
if (isEligibleForProcessing(user)) {
    processEligibleUser(user);
}

private isEligibleForProcessing(user: User): boolean {
    return user.age >= 18 && 
           user.hasValidId && 
           user.isNotBlacklisted && 
           user.hasConsent;
}
```

This makes the main function more readable and the eligibility logic reusable.
```

**Poor Feedback:**
```
❌ This code is bad. Fix it.
```
