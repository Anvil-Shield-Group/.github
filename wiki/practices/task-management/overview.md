    VALIDATION --> PRODUCTION

```

### Task Quality Principles

1. **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Every task has measurable completion criteria
2. **Right-Sized Work**: Tasks are appropriately sized (1-3 days of work)
3. **Independent When Possible**: Tasks can be worked on without blocking dependencies
4. **Valuable**: Each task delivers business or technical value
5. **Traceable**: Tasks link back to features, epics, and business objectives

## Current State Assessment

### Task Management Challenges
- **Inconsistent Descriptions**: Task quality varies significantly between teams
- **Poor Estimation**: 40% of tasks exceed estimated time by >50%
- **Unclear Acceptance Criteria**: 30% of tasks lack clear completion criteria
- **Dependency Management**: Cross-team dependencies not well tracked
- **Limited Visibility**: Difficult to track progress across multiple projects

### Success Areas
- **Active Backlog Management**: Regular grooming and prioritization
- **Good Retrospective Culture**: Teams actively improve their processes
- **Strong Collaboration**: Good communication within individual teams

## Task Description Standards

### Standard Task Template

```markdown
# Task Title: [Action] [Component] [Outcome]
**Example**: Implement User Authentication JWT Token Validation

## Description
Brief description of what needs to be accomplished and why it's needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, measurable outcome 1
- [ ] Specific, measurable outcome 2  
- [ ] Specific, measurable outcome 3

## Technical Details
### Implementation Notes
- Key technical considerations
- Architecture decisions required
- Integration points

### Dependencies
- [ ] Dependency 1: Description and status
- [ ] Dependency 2: Description and status

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implementation complete
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Smoke tests passing

## Estimation
**Story Points**: 5  
**Time Estimate**: 2-3 days  
**Complexity**: Medium

## Labels
`backend`, `authentication`, `security`, `sprint-24`

## Linked Issues
- Epic: #123 - User Authentication System
- Blocks: #456 - User Dashboard Implementation
- Related: #789 - Security Audit Requirements
```

### Task Sizing Guidelines

| Size | Story Points | Time Estimate | Characteristics |
|------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **XS** | 1 | 2-4 hours | Simple bug fix, config change |
| **S** | 2-3 | 0.5-1 day | Small feature, straightforward implementation |
| **M** | 5-8 | 2-3 days | Standard feature with moderate complexity |
| **L** | 13 | 4-5 days | Complex feature requiring research/design |
| **XL** | 21+ | >1 week | Epic-level work, should be broken down |

### Acceptance Criteria Best Practices

#### Good Examples
```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can log in with email and password
- [ ] Invalid credentials show error message "Invalid email or password"
- [ ] Successful login redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Login attempt is logged for security monitoring
- [ ] Account locks after 5 failed attempts
- [ ] Locked account shows appropriate message to user
```

#### Poor Examples
```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login works ❌ (too vague)
- [ ] Handle errors ❌ (not specific)
- [ ] Make it secure ❌ (not measurable)
```

## Project Tracking Standards

### Sprint Planning Process

#### Sprint Planning Meeting Structure (2 hours for 2-week sprint)
1. **Sprint Goal Definition** (15 minutes)
   - Clear, measurable objective for the sprint
   - Aligns with quarterly and project goals

2. **Backlog Review** (30 minutes)
   - Review and refine top priority items
   - Ensure tasks are properly sized and detailed

3. **Capacity Planning** (15 minutes)
   - Team availability assessment
   - Consider vacation, meetings, support duties

4. **Task Selection** (45 minutes)
   - Select tasks that fit sprint goal and capacity
   - Break down large tasks if needed

5. **Commitment & Questions** (15 minutes)
   - Team commits to sprint backlog
   - Address any remaining questions or concerns

### Progress Tracking Metrics

| Metric | Purpose | Target | Current | Frequency |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Sprint Velocity** | Team capacity planning | 40-50 points | 35 points | Per sprint |
| **Sprint Completion Rate** | Predictability | >85% | 78% | Per sprint |
| **Estimation Accuracy** | Planning improvement | <20% variance | 35% variance | Monthly |
| **Cycle Time** | Delivery speed | <5 days | 7.2 days | Weekly |
| **Lead Time** | End-to-end delivery | <10 days | 14.1 days | Weekly |

## Cross-Team Coordination

### Dependency Management

#### Dependency Types and Handling
```markdown
# Dependency Classification

## Hard Dependencies (Blocking)
- Team A cannot proceed without Team B's completion
- **Management**: Explicit coordination, shared timelines
- **Example**: Frontend needs API endpoint before UI implementation

## Soft Dependencies (Preferential)
- Work can proceed but benefits from coordination
- **Management**: Regular communication, flexible timelines
- **Example**: UI design patterns that align with component library

## External Dependencies
- Dependencies on third-party services or vendors
- **Management**: Early identification, risk mitigation
- **Example**: Payment gateway API changes
```

#### Dependency Tracking Template
```markdown
# Cross-Team Dependency: [Description]

## Teams Involved
- **Providing Team**: [Team Name]
- **Consuming Team**: [Team Name]
- **Dependency Owner**: @username

## Dependency Details
- **What's Needed**: Specific deliverable or outcome
- **When Needed**: Target date and flexibility
- **Impact if Delayed**: Business and technical impact

## Coordination Plan
- **Communication Channel**: #shared-project-channel
- **Check-in Frequency**: Weekly/bi-weekly
- **Decision Points**: Key dates for go/no-go decisions
