    subgraph "Source Control"
        CODE[Source Code]
        PR[Pull Request]
    end
    
    subgraph "CI Pipeline"
        BUILD[Build & Package]
        TEST[Automated Testing]
        SCAN[Security & Quality Scans]
        ARTIFACT[Artifact Storage]
    end
    
    subgraph "CD Pipeline"
        DEV[Deploy to Dev]
        STAGE[Deploy to Staging]
        PROD[Deploy to Production]
    end
    
    subgraph "Monitoring"
        HEALTH[Health Checks]
        METRICS[Performance Metrics]
        ALERTS[Automated Alerts]
    end
    
    CODE --> PR
    PR --> BUILD
    BUILD --> TEST
    TEST --> SCAN
    SCAN --> ARTIFACT
    ARTIFACT --> DEV
    DEV --> STAGE
    STAGE --> PROD
    PROD --> HEALTH
    HEALTH --> METRICS
    METRICS --> ALERTS
```

### Core Principles

1. **Automation First**: Automate all repeatable processes
2. **Fast Feedback**: Provide quick feedback on code changes
3. **Fail Fast**: Catch issues early in the pipeline
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: Version control all infrastructure definitions
5. **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Deploy without service interruption
6. **Rollback Ready**: Always have a quick rollback strategy
7. **Security Built-In**: Integrate security scanning throughout the pipeline
8. **Observability**: Monitor and measure pipeline performance

## Current State Assessment

### Pipeline Maturity by Stack

| Stack | Current Maturity | Deployment Frequency | Build Time | Test Coverage Integration |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Spring Boot** | L3 - Advanced | 2-3x daily | 8 minutes | ✅ Coverage gates enabled |
| **ASP.NET Core** | L3 - Advanced | 2-3x daily | 6 minutes | ✅ Coverage gates enabled |
| **NextJS** | L2 - Intermediate | 1x daily | 12 minutes | ⚠️ Partial coverage integration |
| **Flutter** | L2 - Intermediate | Weekly releases | 25 minutes | ⚠️ Limited automation |
| **Laravel** | L1 - Basic | Manual deployments | N/A | ❌ Manual testing |

### Current Challenges

- **Inconsistent Pipeline Standards**: Different approaches across technology stacks
- **Long Build Times**: Some pipelines take >20 minutes, slowing developer feedback
- **Manual Release Steps**: Several manual approval gates create deployment bottlenecks
- **Limited Rollback Testing**: Rollback procedures not regularly tested
- **Environment Drift**: Configuration differences between environments cause issues
- **Security Integration**: Security scans not consistently integrated across all pipelines

### Success Areas

- **Azure DevOps Integration**: Centralized pipeline management and monitoring
- **Automated Testing**: Good unit and integration test automation for backend services
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Terraform-managed infrastructure deployment
- **Monitoring Integration**: Deployment success monitoring and health checks

## CI/CD Standards

### Pipeline Requirements

#### Universal Pipeline Stages

Every deployment pipeline must include these stages:

```yaml
# Standard Pipeline Stages
stages:
  - name: validate
    displayName: 'Code Validation'
    jobs:
      - lint
      - security_scan
      - dependency_check
      
  - name: build
    displayName: 'Build & Package'
    jobs:
      - compile
      - package
      - artifact_upload
      
  - name: test
    displayName: 'Automated Testing'
    jobs:
      - unit_tests
      - integration_tests
      - coverage_check
      
  - name: quality_gates
    displayName: 'Quality Gates'
    jobs:
      - sonar_analysis
      - security_scan
      - performance_test
      
  - name: deploy_dev
    displayName: 'Deploy to Development'
    jobs:
      - deploy
      - smoke_tests
      - health_check
      
  - name: deploy_staging
    displayName: 'Deploy to Staging'
    condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main'))
    jobs:
      - deploy
      - integration_tests
      - user_acceptance_tests
      
  - name: deploy_production
    displayName: 'Deploy to Production'
    condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main'))
    jobs:
      - manual_approval
      - blue_green_deployment
      - health_validation
      - rollback_preparation
```

#### Quality Gates

| Gate | Criteria | Action on Failure |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Unit Test Coverage** | >80% line coverage | Block deployment |
| **Security Scan** | No critical vulnerabilities | Block deployment |
| **Code Quality** | SonarQube Quality Gate passed | Block deployment |
| **Integration Tests** | 100% pass rate | Block deployment |
| **Performance Tests** | Response time within SLA | Warning, manual review |
| **Smoke Tests** | All critical endpoints healthy | Auto-rollback |

### Deployment Strategies

#### Blue-Green Deployment (Recommended for Production)

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Load Balancer"
        LB[Azure Application Gateway]
    end
    
    subgraph "Blue Environment (Current)"
        BLUE1[App Instance 1]
        BLUE2[App Instance 2]
        BLUE3[App Instance 3]
    end
    
    subgraph "Green Environment (New)"
        GREEN1[App Instance 1]
        GREEN2[App Instance 2]
        GREEN3[App Instance 3]
    end
    
    subgraph "Shared Services"
        DB[(Database)]
        CACHE[(Redis Cache)]
        QUEUE[(Message Queue)]
    end
    
    LB --> BLUE1
    LB --> BLUE2
    LB --> BLUE3
    
    BLUE1 -.-> DB
    BLUE2 -.-> CACHE
    BLUE3 -.-> QUEUE
    
    GREEN1 -.-> DB
    GREEN2 -.-> CACHE
    GREEN3 -.-> QUEUE
```

**Process:**
1. Deploy new version to Green environment
2. Run health checks and smoke tests on Green
3. Gradually shift traffic from Blue to Green (10%, 50%, 100%)
4. Monitor metrics during traffic shift
5. Keep Blue environment for quick rollback (24-48 hours)

#### Rolling Deployment (For Development/Staging)

```yaml
# Rolling Deployment Configuration
deployment:
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    maxUnavailable: 25%
    maxSurge: 25%
  healthCheck:
    initialDelaySeconds: 30
    periodSeconds: 10
    timeoutSeconds: 5
    successThreshold: 1
    failureThreshold: 3
```

### Branch Strategy and Pipeline Triggers

#### GitFlow Integration

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Branch Strategy"
        FEATURE[Feature Branches]
        DEVELOP[Develop Branch]
        RELEASE[Release Branches]
        MAIN[Main Branch]
        HOTFIX[Hotfix Branches]
    end
    
    subgraph "Pipeline Triggers"
        PR_BUILD[PR Validation Pipeline]
        DEV_DEPLOY[Auto Deploy to Dev]
        STAGING_DEPLOY[Auto Deploy to Staging]
        PROD_DEPLOY[Manual Deploy to Prod]
        HOTFIX_PIPELINE[Expedited Hotfix Pipeline]
    end
    
    FEATURE --> PR_BUILD
    DEVELOP --> DEV_DEPLOY
    RELEASE --> STAGING_DEPLOY
    MAIN --> PROD_DEPLOY
    HOTFIX --> HOTFIX_PIPELINE
```

#### Pipeline Trigger Rules

| Branch Pattern | Trigger | Target Environment | Approval Required |
|----------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `feature/*` | PR creation/update | PR validation only | Peer review |
| `develop` | Push/merge | Development | Automatic |
| `release/*` | Push/merge | Staging | Automatic |
| `main` | Push/merge | Production | Manual approval |
| `hotfix/*` | Push/merge | All environments | Expedited approval |

## Build Standards

  displayName: 'Cache npm dependencies'
  inputs:
    key: 'npm | "$(Agent.OS)" | package-lock.json'
    restoreKeys: |
      npm | "$(Agent.OS)"
      npm
    path: $(npm_config_cache)

- task: Cache@2
  displayName: 'Cache Maven dependencies'
  inputs:
    key: 'maven | "$(Agent.OS)" | **/pom.xml'
    restoreKeys: |
      maven | "$(Agent.OS)"
      maven
    path: $(MAVEN_CACHE_FOLDER)
```

#### Parallel Build Jobs
```yaml
# Parallel Test Execution
jobs:
- job: UnitTests
  displayName: 'Unit Tests'
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
  strategy:
    parallel: 4
  steps:
    - script: npm run test:unit:parallel
    
- job: IntegrationTests
  displayName: 'Integration Tests'
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
  dependsOn: []
  steps:
    - script: npm run test:integration
```

## Security Integration

### Security Scanning Pipeline

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Security Gates"
        SAST[Static Application Security Testing]
        DAST[Dynamic Application Security Testing]
        DEPS[Dependency Vulnerability Scan]
        SECRETS[Secret Detection]
        LICENSE[License Compliance]
    end
    
    subgraph "Tools Integration"
        SONAR[SonarQube Security Rules]
        SNYK[Snyk Vulnerability Database]
        TRUFFLEHOG[TruffleHog Secret Scanner]
        OWASP[OWASP ZAP]
        WHITESOURCE[WhiteSource License Check]
    end
    
    SAST --> SONAR
    DAST --> OWASP
    DEPS --> SNYK
    SECRETS --> TRUFFLEHOG
    LICENSE --> WHITESOURCE
```
